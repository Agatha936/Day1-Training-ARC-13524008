        <p>
            Agatha was born in Bogor, Indonesia on March 9th 2006. She is currently a first year Informatics Student in Institut Teknologi Bandung, Jatinangor, where she just started her second semester. Agatha always has her interest in some challenges and things she never did before, such as joining ARC:). Growing up, she found herself curious and wanted to know better about the rapid technology development. It began in the 11th grade, where she first studied python at school. Despite the knowledge she has got from robotics class in elementary school, her curiosity thrives even bigger in high school. Her parents work self-employed, so most of the time she spent playing and hanging out with her sister and brother.
